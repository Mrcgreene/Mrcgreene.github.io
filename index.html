         <h3>Sports History</h3>
		 <h2>
         <p>His introduction into athlectics and the sports world began when he was a mere teenager. Craig Greene received his first form of organized coaching while participating on his 8th grade basketball team at Samuel Morse Middle School. While at this school, he was also involved with the gymnastics program. This was something that he dug into in his younger years by simply doing backflips with neighborhood friends. He expanded those and other experiences into slightly more intense competition as he entered high school. At Milwaukee Tech, Craig tried out for and made the freshmen basketball team. That same year he found it necessary to become apart of the track team. After dedicating his time and energy to both, he was able to pull portions of his track training to ultimately enhance his basketball performance.</p>
